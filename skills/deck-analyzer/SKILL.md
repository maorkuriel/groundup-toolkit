- Sender email for DocSend authentication

## Integration Examples

### From OpenClaw Agent

```bash
openclaw agent ask "Analyze this deck: https://docsend.com/view/abc123"
```

The agent will automatically use this skill to fetch and analyze the deck.

### From Deal Logger

The deal-logger skill can automatically use deck-analyzer when it finds deck links in emails:

```python
# In deal logging workflow
deck_links = extract_deck_links(email_body)
if deck_links:
    deck_info = analyze_deck(deck_links[0], sender_email)
    # Use deck_info to enrich deal description
```

### Manual CLI

```bash
# Analyze a specific deck
~/.openclaw/skills/deck-analyzer/deck-analyzer analyze https://docsend.com/view/abc123

# Extract links from an email
cat email.txt | ~/.openclaw/skills/deck-analyzer/deck-analyzer extract-links

# Test the analyzer
~/.openclaw/skills/deck-analyzer/deck-analyzer test
```

## Technical Details

- **AI Model:** Claude Haiku 4.5 (fast, cost-effective)
- **Dependencies:** requests (HTTP client)

## Output Format

**JSON format** for programmatic use:
```json

  ...
}
```

## Use Cases

### Quick Deck Review
Before a meeting, quickly extract key info from a deck:
```bash
deck-analyzer analyze https://docsend.com/view/abc123
```

### Automated Deal Enrichment
When deal-logger finds a deck in an email, automatically analyze it:
```python
deck_info = analyze_deck(deck_url, sender_email)
company_description = format_company_description(deck_info)
# Add to HubSpot deal
```

### Batch Deck Processing
Process multiple decks from a list:
```bash
while read url; do
  deck-analyzer analyze "$url"
done < deck_urls.txt
```

## Limitations

- **DocSend authentication:** Some DocSend links require email verification
- **Content extraction:** Only extracts visible text, not images
- **PDF support:** Basic PDF text extraction (may miss formatted content)
- **Rate limits:** Subject to Claude API rate limits

## Troubleshooting

**"ANTHROPIC_API_KEY not set"**
```bash
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
```

**DocSend access denied:**
- Try providing sender email: `deck-analyzer analyze URL sender@email.com`
- DocSend may require browser-based authentication

**No information extracted:**
- Deck may be image-based (no text to extract)
- Content may be behind authentication
- Try downloading PDF and analyzing locally

**Timeout errors:**
- Large decks may take longer
- Try again or use a faster network connection

## Privacy & Security

- Deck content is sent to Claude API for analysis
- No deck content is stored permanently
- Authentication cookies are not persisted
- Sender emails only used for DocSend auth requests
